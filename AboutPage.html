            <p>
                The Overachieving Underachievers started as a school project by our founders Nathaniel Kiremitciyan, Harry Webb , Krish Sheemar and Aiden Stott. But it quickly grew into something more. 
            </p>

            <h1>Our Mission <span></h1>
            <p>
                We belive that not all work is created equally. There are many aspects when it comes to creating for work, the mundane for example the bottom of the barrel work that anyone can do like writing lazy and contrived website paragraphs. We do the mundane work for you, so you can get back to the important parts you're doing while we get the meaningless gibber gabber in the middle done.

    <h1><strong>Our values</strong></h1>
    <p>
        We believe not just in growing bigger, but in growing better. And growing better means aligning the success of your own business with the success of your customers. Win-win!
